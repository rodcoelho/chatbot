# Chatbot

Blah

#### Step 1 - Setup

Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/rodcoelho/chatbot.git`

#### Step 2: Run
Run `$ python3 rodbot.py`

Once you run the script, Bot will come to life. You can say things like:
    <li> input: How are you?
    <li> output: Good and you?
    <li> input: Great!
    <li> output: That's nice to hear.
    <li> input: 12 + 12
    <li> output: 12 + 12 = 24
    
    
BUT... you can ALSO say things like:
    <li> input: github
    <li> input: who is Rod?
    <li> input: linkedin
    <li> input: Google: What is life?
